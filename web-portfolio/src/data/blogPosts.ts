    title: 'life vs death',
    date: 'September 25, 2025',
    content: 'Many people believe that death should be accepted as they say that it is “natural.” However, they misunderstand nature. They think that nature is some constant thing that has rules and things that must happen in the past, present, and future. However, nature is an ever changing and evolving thing. If we look in the past, when life first started, we see that they developed traits and features that helped them survive. Survive can also be understood as the act of not dying. Therefore, we as animals have developed things that help us not die for millions of years. This is almost as if animals do not want to die, as if we will do anything to not die, as if we are constantly improving ourselves to not die, as if nature does not want to die. This means that just as in the past, we strive to not die, in the present we can follow this process too. We as animals, as nature itself, must work on not dying. We eat to not die, we drink to not die, we study to not die, we work to not die, everything we do is in part, to not die. If we look at babies, which have no external education and live simply off of the instincts that nature provided it, it does everything it can to survive. It cries, it eats, it crawls, all in order to live. The body itself can regenerate from injury so that it can live. Everything we do is in order to live and not die. Therefore, we must do everything in our power to not die. We must fear death.'

    content: 'Debugging is a process that can be applied to anything. It is a way to find the root of the problem and fix it. It is a way to understand the problem and the solution. It is a way to learn and grow. It is a way to be better. \n \n If you are unhappy, debug it. Sounds simple but is truly a revealing process.'

    title: 'the importance of writing',
    date: 'May 21, 2025',
    content: 'Writing is a permanent snapshot of your thoughts and ideas. It is the way we express what goes inside of our minds and publicate it to the world. While being considered overrated by those who prefer video logs, it can be a truly rewarding experience. \n \n Writing can be quick, slow, long, short, thought, thoughtless, stressful, stress-relieving, temporary or permament. It is a way to take a fraction of you in a certain moment of time, which is what makes it all the more special. '

    content: 'Having bad and good is part of a quality life. Smelling, seeing, hearing, felling all have good parts and bad parts. Would you like to get rid of them completely to get rid of bad parts? Would you get rid of your nose so that you never have to smell anything bad again? Would you get rid of your hands so that you never have to feel something painful again? Would you get rid of your eyes so that you never have to see something bad again? Would you get rid of your tongue so that you never have to taste anything bad again? No. There is a balance to them. Many people believe that we should get rid of pleasures and pains, but in reality they are part of this balance. Of course, sometimes that balance can become uneven, but this does not mean to get rid of them completely. '
