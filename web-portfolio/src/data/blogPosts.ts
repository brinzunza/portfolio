    content: 'here are some of the thoughts and ideas that i think about pretty often. I am writing them down for two reasons: *for me not to forget them and for me to deeply understand what goes on internally.* I guess also to see how I have changed over time. \n\nI would like to say that all of these thoughts were my own, but the truth is that everything here is simply a compilation of things that I have learned, heard, read, or seen over the years. This means, **assume nothing I write is original, but rather bits and pieces of others that I tried to interpret.**\n\n the goal is to make these a slow read. Not because they are dense and hard to read, but rather because they are meant to trigger thought and reflection. I have only come to appreciate and begin writing until recently, so bear with me if my style is unorganized, contradictory, and hard to understand. \n\nThe content of the writings is variable, meaning that I might write about nearly anything; either blantantly obvious or outrageously controversial. If there is anything offensive, controversial, or factually false in the readings, it is either my ignorance or satire. There is no real chronological order to the writings either, so feel free to start and stop anywhere.\n\n also, every character written in these come organically from my brain and are typed using my hands. I refuse to rely on anything or anyone else for the purpose of integrity.'

    title: 'routine vs spontaneity',
    date: 'October 23, 2025',
    content: 'Life moves fast already so don’t just go through the motions. Ever felt that you spent the past few days, weeks, or months without achieving anything? Or felt that you miss home after traveling for a long period of time? Both reveal that benefits of routine and it’s opposite, spontaneity. \n\n**routine** has pros and cons. \n\n*pros* \n\n- it reduces cognitive load. when you do something through routine where you don’t have to think about it too much, it allows you to use the free mental space and power on something else while still achieving the original task you wanted to complete. This is important to be a productive and effective person. Being able to handle important daily tasks without having to pay high attention is useful when you have other high attention tasks.\n\n- it builds momentum and discipline. Most successes are a result of small continuous, long efforts. routine promotes you to work on those goals little by little until you achieve the goal in the long run. Being able to do these tasks, regardless of size, builds discipline which can be applied to many other aspects of your life. This brings more control to who you want to be and what you want to achieve.\n\n- your health improves. our bodies work in patterns meaning that if you sleep on schedule, eat your meals on schedule, and workout on schedule, it has proven to improve physical health, decrease stress, and stabilize mood.\n\n*cons*\n\n- you do things without understanding their purpose and lose the ability to change them when necessary. they become habits and habits shape who we are. making sure that these habits in our routine are beneficial is highly important as they become difficult to change or stop once built.\n\n- structure misses opportunities. making a routine that is too strict to break leads to failure to adapt to unexpected circumstances. it is impossible to predict the future and not adapting to it, fails to optimize personal growth.\n\n- routine can stunt growth. If you refuse to have an open routine to be properly updated and changed, you can grow in only a select few areas while lacking the ability to grow in others.\n\n**spontaneity** has pros and cons\n\n*pros* \n\n- promotes creativity and freedom. being able to choose what you do and when gives you the freedom to be more present. It also gives you the choice to be happier in moments where routine would have held you back.\n\n- mentally allows you to think differently and updated. as previously stated, it is impossible to predict the future, therefore being able to adapt to new things keeps you up to date and open to change. it builds resilience to new and unexpected things.\n\n- increases happiness and curiosity. living with less structure allows you to evaluate the present and do what you find interesting in the moment. It gives you the choice, which gives more control, over what you want to do as you grow.\n\n*cons*\n\n- disorganized and chaotic. relying too hard on spontaneity can lead to a lack of planning, or a lack of achieving.\n\n- increased stress as the constant decisions you have to make create uncertainty and anxiety, especially when you aren’t prepared for the consequences or outcomes.\n\n- lack of accountability. without routine, it becomes very easy to procrastinate and leave things undone which later leads to incomplete goals and feelings of regret.\n\nfinding a balance is really important and equally as hard. A way I found balance was to make a list of things that i want to complete in the future. Then filter it out by things that really matter for the future. Then filter it again by things that absolutely, undeniably are good for my future. Then more. Then, really commit to it. Having it stay lean allows me to get those vital tasks done and leave the rest of the day to live spontaneously giving me the best of both worlds. \n\nIt takes time and effort to establish these and will not be a quick process, but worthwhile nonetheless.'

    title: 'opportunity cost',
    date: 'October 8, 2025',
    content: 'your second largest cost is taxes, largest is opportunity cost\n\nTime is money. Is this statement true? Maybe. What would I change it to? Time is the root currency. Everything else are derivatives. The difference is that the value of time is highly volatile. Depending on the things that you do is what gives that time worth. Since the current state of our knowledge limits us to a finite set of years alive, we are given limited time which we are meant to put value to. We face day to day decisions that impact this value of our time. Most of these require attention and an evaluation of a multitude of options. What is overlooked? The importance of making the best decision available.\n\nLoss aversion is one strategy that our brain employs that hinders our decision making. Our mind feels the pain of a loss greater than the pleasure of an equivalent gain. It makes us avoid losses more than desire wins. It skews our ability to pay more attention to the cost of an investment rather than the benefits that it provides.\n\nSince the future is unknown and the further you look into it, the less obvious things become, we tend to choose immediate or short term gains over the long term gains. We use a greedy algorithm to find what is immediately the best decision hoping that it will result in the optimal long term decision but hoping is flawed.\n\nSociety, inevitably, has a high impact on the decision making of people. They impact what we choose to value and push our decision making to some order. Essentially, they remove a lot of our creativity and push on a lot of limits. Society pushes us to do good for society over oneself. Does this mean to follow that social law and sacrifice your happiness and potential for others? Maybe, maybe not. \n\nNow, when it comes to figuring out all of your options for the current decision, the vast amount of options can result in cognitive overload. We choose to ignore the opportunity cost of the decision not made to simplify decision making. It is unrealistic to believe that one must calculate absolutely everything for a specific decision, but making it too simple lacks proper thought. \n\nThere are many of us that are too comfortable in our current position to choose the optimal path. We are scared of change or are satisfied with less and therefore we aren’t convinced to make the necessary change. In our current job we either don’t want to change our routine, are scared to go through the job seeking phase, or make enough money.'

    title: 'fulfillment',
    date: 'October 7, 2025',
    content: 'The more I think about this, the more it renders to be true. In nearly all things done by humans, the level of output is independent on the level of input. Not everyone’s output requires equal input. When it comes to doing work, or anything that requires effort, people have different strengths and weaknesses. You shouldn’t expect the effort of a doctor to be the same as an engineer when it comes to math. Likewise, an engineer would probably struggle when it comes to human biology. \n\nYet, the fulfillment people get from doing hard things seems to be equal in all domains. Hard things challenge people and challenging things pushes people to and past their capable limits. It exposes their bottlenecks and weaknesses and forces them to grow. Regardless of the output of some task, large or small, we appreciate the internal growth and development that we gain from these moments. The internal transformation is what is most fulfilling. We grow stronger, smarter, we gain more confidence in that domain and in our overall ability to solve difficult problems. \n\nIn a life without a pre-packaged sense of purpose and direction, we must choose what to life for. A life devoid of challenge can easily become a life without meaning. It causes boredom, apathy, and a sense that nothing matters.  Fulfillment makes us happier. \n\nDoing hard things is a reinforcement learning loop. Once we start doing hard, fulfilling things, we are more likely to continue. The moment we overcome something we didn’t believe possible, our brain rewards us. It gives us dopamine and confidence to continue. The dopamine gives us motivation to do another similarly difficult task. We cannot repeat the same task as we’ve already passed that hurdle. Running a marathon the second time does not compare to your first, unless, of course, you run it faster which is very difficult. Doing work that is both fun and fulfilling is where you enter into “flow state”. A state where you are constantly motivated to keep working on a task optimally difficult that it requires work, but not so hard that it feels impossible. \n\nHard things are hard for a lot of people. People like to stand out. Doing things few can do makes you stand out. Therefore, hard things make you stand out. People recognize and respect high effort because it is hard. You gain a little bit of fame every time that you do something hard. It builds your social credibility. People can trust and rely on you to be able to solve problems which opens a vast amount of doors for you. Our accomplishments can also outlast us, leaving behind what might be a legacy that was build through these specific moments. \n\nThe key to gaining this sense of fulfillment, however, is agency and purpose. You have to choose to do these hard things. Choosing to run a marathon is hard, but fulfilling. Being forced to do hard, strenuous labor is just suffering. A sense of control over decisions is a vital key. Purpose is no less important. Digging a hole and filling it back up is difficult but mostly unfulfilling. That is because it lacks purpose. Each hard task you choose to do must be in service of some greater goal that you believe to be worth the struggle. \n\nLife is contrasted but balanced. Joy is amplified by previous moments of sadness, equally as ability and fulfillment are amplified by difficult, high effort tasks. So get working…on hard things…because you will be happier.'

  //   date: 'September 25, 2025',
  //   content: 'no one in history has survived death. death seems to exist in nearly every living thing. many people believe that death should be accepted claiming it is “natural.” however, using the excuse that something is “natural” is not a fair justification for us to think it is required to happen. they think that nature is some constant thing that has rules and things that must happen in the past, present, and future. however, nature is an ever changing and evolving thing. \n\nif we look in the past, when life first started, we see that they developed traits and features that helped them survive. survive can also be understood as the act of not dying. therefore, we as animals have developed things that help us not die for millions of years. this is almost as if animals do not want to die, as if we will do anything to not die, as if we are constantly improving ourselves to not die, as if nature does not want to die. \n\njust as in the past, we strive to not die, in the present we can follow this process too. we as animals, as nature itself, must work on not dying. we eat to not die, we drink to not die, we study to not die, we work to not die, everything we do is in part, to not die. if we look at babies, which have no external education and live simply off of the instincts that nature provided it, it does everything it can to survive. it cries, it eats, it crawls, all in order to live. the body itself can regenerate from injury so that it can live. everything we do is in order to live and not die. therefore, we must do everything in our power to not die.'

    title: 'debugging',
    date: 'May 22, 2025',
    content: 'debugging: the process of identifying and removing errors from computer hardware or software.\n\nin the realm of computer science, debugging is a commonly used term referenced to fixing some type of unknown problem. It involves multi step planning, executing, noting, and iterating to find the proper solution. It is notorious for taking a lot of time and effort and has been one of the main challenges that engineers face day to day. In many cases, what separates a novice engineer versus a senior engineer are the abilities to handle complex and unique bugs. Their ability to do a deep dive on different components and puzzle together the solution results in high quality solutions to any problem. \n\ndebugging is multifaceted and should be applied to ones professional and personal life. The process is a difficult but rewarding one what includes the following:\n\nidentifying the bug. taking a deep dive into the problem that you are experiences and noting all of the possible things that affect it. It takes time and effort to expose all the things that affect this and learn what you can do about it. This step takes time and concrete evidence which should include specific data about what you do or not do. The key is to articulate the problem with precision and complete honesty. You cannot sugarcoat or curve details. Be completely transparent with yourself. \n\nanalyze the logs. Look back at your current routine, habits, or actions. How do they affect this problem? This may include asking others about what they notice.\n\nset breakpoints and isolate. A complex problem often is a combination of several smaller issues. The goal is to isolate the root cause. Divide up the things that affect your issue and evaluation. The further you isolate, the more you will learn about yourself. This step is the most enlightening because it exposes things that you had not expected and allows you to grow in more ways than expected. \n\napply a patch. Create an attempt to fix the issue. It does not have to be something big. It should be one that can be easily changed if incomplete to your problem. \n\niterate. Continue this process over and over. Nobody is perfect; everybody should be constantly debugging themselves. There will never be a singular solution that will resolve all problems and some solutions may even create problems or hinder from other solutions to being implemented. It takes flexibility and discipline to complete. \n\ndebugging is a process that can be applied to anything. it is a way to find the root of the problem and fix it. it is a way to understand the problem and the solution. it is a way to learn and grow. it is a way to be better.\n\nif you are unhappy, debug it. sounds simple but is truly a revealing process.'

    title: 'the importance of writing',
    date: 'May 21, 2025',
    content: 'Writing is a permanent snapshot of your thoughts and ideas. It is the way we express what goes inside of our minds and physically store it. Most of the time it allows us to know what we are thinking. Writing clears the chaos in your head and allows you to have a dialogue with yourself. You can question, challenge, and expand on your ideas during this time of reflection.  \n\nWriting can be quick, slow, long, short, thought, thoughtless, stressful, stress-relieving, temporary or permanent. It is a way to take a fraction of you in a certain moment of time, which is what makes it all the more special. Looking back on who you used to be is a great way to feel nostalgia and to see progress. When you create this writings, they become breakpoints in your life that can show how you’ve changed and what things really made in impact on you.\n\nLife is busy and complex. There are too many details that we want to remember but our short and long term memories bottleneck us. It may be easy to remember something for a short term but once your memory fills up, you unconsciously forgot those older memories and if not for writing, would be gone forever. One of the most common and uncomfortable feelings is when you know you have things to do but can’t remember them, writing solves this. \n\nWriting for others is historically the most efficient mode of communication. When we read things from others, we learn from them. We learn about what they think, believe, love, hate, etc. It puts us in their shoes for a small moment and allows us to understand who they are. People learn through experiences and sometimes these writings function as an experience. We can live vicariously through the author and understand situations even though we don’t truly live them. \n\nWriting is conviction. When you write something, it is because you believe in it enough to write it. It may sound trivial but has more merit to it. The simple act of writing a business plan, a project proposal, or a set of personal goals transforms an abstract idea into a concrete plan of action. It is the first step in turning an idea into reality. Writing isn’t just be about recording what is, but also what could be. '

    content: 'Having bad and good is part of a quality life. Smelling, seeing, hearing, felling all have good parts and bad parts. Would you like to get rid of them completely to get rid of bad parts? Would you get rid of your nose so that you never have to smell anything bad again? Would you get rid of your hands so that you never have to feel something painful again? Would you get rid of your eyes so that you never have to see something bad again? Would you get rid of your tongue so that you never have to taste anything bad again? No. There is a balance to them. \n\nMany people believe that we should get rid of pleasures and pains, but in reality they are part of this balance. Of course, sometimes that balance can become uneven, but this does not mean to get rid of them completely. '
