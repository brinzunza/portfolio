When you look at people with real wealth, I mean REAL wealth, it rarely comes in a form other than from equity in a company or some investment. These investments are powerful because your investment grows in proportion to the growth of the company. Meaning if you invest in a company that grows 10% over the course of a year and you invested $100, your equity, or your share of the company, would then be $110. Your new value $110 minus the original $100, means that you made $10 profit.

Doesn’t seem like much, but now assume that you invested $1,000,000 in that same company for that same year with growth 10%. Since the property that your investment grows in proportion to the company persists, your new investment would be valued at $1,100,000. That’s a $100,000 profit. $100,000 can be life changing money for a lot of people.

The important thing to note here is that it took the same amount of effort for the $10 to grow 10%, as it did for the $1,000,000 to grow 10%. 

This example shows growth over a year but growth can happen over a short amount of time, too. Stocks can move a lot over a single day. If some big news or financial statements come out for a specific company, it may move over 10% in a single day. 

However, a growth of 10% is easily as attainable as a loss of 10%. After a loss, it takes more effort to recover. For example with a loss of 10% on a $1,000 investment, it would take 11.11% to get back to your $1,000. Why? Here’s the math:

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <img src="/bat-trading/math3.png" alt="Math" width="100%" style="display: block;"/>
</div>

Now the powerful thing about these percentage gains on our investments is that it compounds. The compound effect is where small steps build off of each other to exponentially make larger and larger steps. What does this look like? Well if we look back to our investment of $1,000 and we gain 10% per year for 10 consecutive years, we would have a total investment of $2,593.75. If you notice, 10% of $1,000 is $100. $100 * 10 years equals $1,000. $1,000 plus $1,000 is $2,000. Yet our total is more than that. This is because of compound interest. Where instead of each year being %10 of $1,000, it becomes 10% of our new investment value. Here’s what it looks like:

This is why people mention to start investment or retirement accounts at a young age. Because more time allows compounding to grow exponentially quicker. At the start of an investment, 10% in a year might only be $100, but with compounding it could grow to 10% in a year resulting in $1,000,000+. 

This is the power of investments. 

How does this relate to Algorithmic Trading? Well, in essence, trading is short term investing. This can be in the form of entering and exiting a certain investment in a single year, single month, single week, single day, or even single minute. Why would someone want to trade short term? Well, the stock market fluctuates. Some days it goes up 1%+, some days it goes down 1%-, and some days it doesn’t move much. The goal may be to either gain from these fluctuations or prevent themselves from losses when the market goes down. 

If a stock moves up 10% in a year, their goal might be to trade the fluctuations to get more than a 10% return.

If a stock stays at the same price from the start of the year, their goal might be to trade the fluctuations to get more than a 0% return.

If a stock falls 10% in a year, their goal might be to trade the fluctuations to lose less than 10% or even gain.

Trading becomes lucrative because of the power to do this. However, trading is not just random, there are different reasons on when to either buy or sell a stock. That is where the money is. Your analysis and strategy of stocks is the key to either making a lot of money or losing a lot of money. Trading is usually a high risk, high reward activity. Popular strategies include technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and quantitative analysis. 

Technical analysis is the strategy where people buy and sell stocks based on patterns in their movement on a chart. They believe that historical prices and volumes are able to predict future outcomes. They are typically looking at different tickers, different timeframes, and using different tools to find predictive patterns from the stocks movement. 

Fundamental analysis is the strategy where people buy and sell stocks based on the news about the certain company or news about things that directly impact that company. They are typically reading about mergers and acquisitions, financial statements, government policies, the federal reserve, etc. 

Quantitative/Algorithmic trading is the strategy where people use computers to buy and sell stocks based on mathematical models to find trading opportunities and execute trades at high speeds. Algorithmic trading can also automate or expedite the process of technical analysis and fundamental analysis. 

Bruninvestor Algorithmic Trading is the Algorithmic trading approach. It is meant to use computers to your benefit to find successful strategies and then automate it. The main flaws in technical and fundamental analysis that algorithmic trading solves are the follow:

- When humans are in charge of entering and exiting positions, their emotions can affect their decision making, creating opportunities for unexpected decisions to occur.
- When humans are in charge of entering and exiting positions, their decision making time can be delayed which can result in price moving away from your desired entry or exit point.
- Humans can trade by feelings instead of data, resulting in no justified or inconsistent results.

Finding a strategy used to require lots of days if not months of backtesting but with the power of computers, it can complete this backtesting in less than a minute. You may be asking, what is backtesting? The concept of backtesting is applying your given strategy on historical data to test if it would have been successful in the past with the assumption that the market is going to have similar behavior in the future. Backtesting should be applied on unseen historical data. You cannot see the historical data you will be testing on as it would create over fitting where it may be successful well here but not in any other situation. Using this platform to backtest a strategy such as Conservative Mean Reversion results in: 

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">

</div>
A strategy such as Conservative Mean Reversion requires certain factors: When to enter a buy position, when to enter a sell position, when to take profit, or stop loss. Conservative Mean Reversion is a strategy used in quantitative analysis where it uses statistics to track when the mean price is for a certain range and then use standard deviation to enter positions assuming that the price is going to return to the calculated mean price. 

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <img src="/bat-trading/graph.png" alt="Math" width="100%" style="display: block;"/>
</div>

Here we can see how when price reached the bottom standard deviation band, it would enter a buy signal and when price returned to the mean, it would close a position. 

Currently there is no guaranteed profitable strategy in the stock market but you don’t need to. Assuming that you limit yourself to lose and win the same amount per trade, you only need to win more than 50% of your trades to be profitable. On the other hand, you can remain profitable with a low win rate if you win more than you risk to lose. 

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <img src="/bat-trading/table2.png" alt="Math" width="100%" style="display: block;"/>
</div>

The standard however, is to make sure you win more than 8% per year. The reasoning behind that number is that the Standard and Poor’s 500 (S&P500) has historically grown by 8% consistently for many decades. Therefore, if you made less than 8% trading that year, you would have benefitted more by simply buying and holding the S&P500. 

Trading this is difficult and requires an immense amount of time and effort. That is why hedge funds exist. These are firms that take your money and invest for you. Their goal is to prevent losses when the market is bearish (trending downward) and make a lot of money when the market is bullish (trending upward). In the past, they used to use a lot of technical and fundamental analysis to trade for you, however more recently they have invested vast amounts of resources into quantitative research and development to make algorithms that can automate trading and be successful. Some have proved to beat the market but the majority, contrary to popular belief, actually fall short compared to the S&P500 over the long term. 

What does that mean? That means that they have not found a profitable solution yet. Does this mean that we, as individual traders, can’t either? No. It simply takes innovation and creativity to find a solution that can solve the market. Will a certain successful strategy always beat the market? No. The market adapts and changes constantly, there will almost never be a “one size fits all” type of strategy. The purpose of this platform is to bring accessibility to those who want to implement their own strategies along with the power of algorithmic trading.
