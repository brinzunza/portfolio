here are some of the projects that I have worked on and developed over the years of my coding career.

due to the quick growth in technology and in my personal understanding of it, **all projects are and always will be in progress.** they are meant to be things that I want to learn more about, wish existed in the world, or have some friction from me accessing (for example: high prices or limited user control).

all projects can be used and manipulated. I have used a lot of code from others and would like to pass that torch on. however, *please spend the time to understand the code.* I cannot guarantee a completely safe and functional product so use that to your discretion.
