In the current age of misinformation, it has become easy for people to be convinced of things that objectively are not true. The issue with this, is that once they are convinced, they easy and confidently spread this misinformation which causes exponential spread of it. There have then been times when I speak with people convinced of wrong information and they have been so well convinced that I struggle to properly counter them. The best way to fix this, is to improve my critical thinking and debating skills. But that is hard. Instead, why don’t I be lazy and make an llm come up with that.

*What does that take…?*

Manually writing they argument into ChatGPT?
- **Too long.** 

Put ChatGPT voice mode?
- **It’ll interrupt and respond to everything we say instead of what the other person says.**

Muting and unmuting ChatGPT when the other person talks?
- **Too many buttons needing to be pressed.**

These all reduce the attention I can put to the other person. A proper solution is one that can keep the conversation flow, provide accurate information, and requires no manual effort. The solution? 

**Mixed Reality + Audio Transcription + Computer Vision + LLM**
