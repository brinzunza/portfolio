In the current age of misinformation, it has become easy for people to be convinced of things that objectively are not true. The issue with this, is that once they are convinced, they easily and confidently spread this misinformation causing an exponential rate of spreading. There have then been times when I speak with people convinced of wrong information, and being as convinced that I struggle to properly counter them. The best way to fix this, is to improve my critical thinking and debating skills. But that is hard. Instead, why don’t I be lazy and make an llm come up with that.

*What does that take…?*

Manually writing their argument into ChatGPT?
- **Too long.** 

Put ChatGPT into voice mode to hear their argument?
- **It’ll interrupt and respond to everything we say instead of just what the other person says.**

Muting and unmuting ChatGPT when the other person talks?
- **Too many buttons needing to be pressed.**

These all reduce the attention I can put to the other person. A proper solution is one that can keep the conversation flow, provide accurate information, and requires no manual effort. The solution? 

**Mixed Reality + Audio Transcription + Computer Vision + LLM**

As we approach a future with mixed reality, we have greater access to cameras, and consequently computer vision. We exploit this and use a camera to watch the other person speak to proper calculate when the person is talking and when they are not. Using the dimensions of their face and their mouth, we detect when they are talking and enable audio transcription. As they speak, the computer listens to their argument and once they finish, it gets fed into a system for fact checking and counter arguing. An llm puts it all together and responds in a format that is easy for the user to comprehend and analyze. With a comfortable, non-obstructing interface, you can continue the flow of the conversation while having this assist your case. 

TLDR: This platform is an ai-powered real-time fact checker and counter-arguer that listens to the statements of the person you’re debating and has a seamless interface for easy reading. Regardless of what the other person is talking about, it gives you proper fact checking and a counter. Either for serious situations or for a casual satirical debates it comes up with information that can guarantee a win…
